# WELCOME TO THIS ACCOUNTING APP 

This projects is written in English and Python. This is a first draft, it's public because why wouldn't it be, I want to make it available to anyone anyway. And if people passing by see it, it's for the better. It's my first attempt at programming with Flask. 
I tried modelling a MVC architecture, even though Flask isn't concieved to work with a MVC architecture. MVC architecture works in three parts : model, view, and controller. It consists in separating backend and frontend logic, and it helps with security and maintainability. 

# What is this app ? 
I've been doing personnal accounting on excel for years and now that I code I wanted to do my own app to do my personnal accounting. I wanted something : 
* That I could access from anywhere
* That I could model to my taste exactly
* That could handle easily several accounts (just in case I want to share this with my friends, accounting is useful and I know people have asked me for my excel base sheets)
* I also wanted pretty visualizations (and will be using seaborn)
* And I wanted to be able to do nice categorization of spendings and visualize it.

In the end, the goal will be to be able to make it a simple app you can self-host on your server. I want to make it compatible with YunoHost.

Ultimately this app might also get a budgeting function. 

# If you want to help / code thigs / fork things :
* have python installed
* ideally, make an environment with anaconda or venv or your favorite environment manager (mine is anaconda but you're free to use anything you want)
* clone the repository, or fork, or whatever
* conda (or pip) install requirements.txt 
* python -m flask run 
* boom ! Up and running.
