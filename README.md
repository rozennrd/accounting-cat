# WELCOME TO THIS ACCOUNTING APP 

This projects is written in english and python. This is a first draft, it's public because why wouldn't it be, I want to make it available to anyone anyway. It's my first attempt at programming with Flask. 
I tried modelling a MVC architecture. MVC architecture works in three parts : model, view, and controller. 

# What is this app ? 
I've been doing personnal accounting on excel for years and I wanted something : 
* That I could access from anywhere
* That I could model to my taste exactly
* That could handle easily several accounts
* I also wanted pretty visualizations
* And I wanted to be able to do nice visualizations and categorization of spendings 

In the end, the goal will be to be able to make it a simple app you can self-host on your server. I want to make it compatible with YunoHost. 

# If you want to help / code thigs / fork things 
* have python installed
* ideally, make an environment with anaconda or venv or your favorite environment manager
* clone the repository, or fork, or whatever
* conda (or pip) install requirements.txt 
* python -m flask run 
* boom ! Up and running.
